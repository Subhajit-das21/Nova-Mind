       <div class="faq_question">Question: Is online education as effective as face-to-face instruction?</div>
    
               <div class="faq_answer">Online education may seem relatively new, 
                but years of research suggests it can be just as effective as traditional coursework, 
                and often more so. According to a U.S. Department of Education analysis of more 
                than 1,000 learning studies, online students tend to outperform classroom-based students across 
                most disciplines and demographics. Another major review published the same year found that online students 
                had the advantage 70 percent of the time, a gap authors projected would only widen as programs and technologies evolve.</div>
            </div> 
        <div class="faq_question">Question: Is online education more conducive to cheating?</div>
            
               <div class="faq_answer">A study by Marshall University found that the students attending live courses have a 
                higher tendency to cheat than the ones attending online courses.Another reason cheating is less common in online programs 
                is that colleges have adopted strict anti-cheating protocols and technologies. According to a report published by the Online Learning Consortium, 
                some online courses require students to report to proctored testing facilities to complete exams, though virtual proctoring using shared screens and webcams is increasingly popular.</div>
            </div> 
        <div class="faq_question">Question: How interactive can online learning be?</div>
            
               <div class="faq_answer">The quick answer is very interactive! And the more interactive, the better.
                With the advancements in authoring software and LXPâ€™s, online learning is more interactive than ever before. 
                Multimedia content creates plenty of opportunities for the learner to take complete control over their learning experience.
                Nowadays especially with the introduction of AI and AI-powered chatbots, learning and doubt-solving has become even more interactive and engaging.</div>
            </div>
        <div class="faq_question">Question: How can the use of AI be helpful for students?</div>
            
               <div class="faq_answer">AI can be a student's best friend! Imagine having a personal tutor who's always available, knows everything, and can explain anything in a way you understand. 
                That's what AI can offer! It also provides personalized learning and instant doubt solving so that that the student does not have to waste his time on the internet searching for a clear answer to the 
                particular question he/she has</div>
